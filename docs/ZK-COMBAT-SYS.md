# ZK-COMBAT-SYS - Zeitklingen: Timeline-Based Combat Interface

## Core Concept

The timeline-based combat interface revolutionizes how players interact with time as a core game mechanic. Instead of traditional static positioning, the interface visualizes enemy actions on a horizontal time axis, creating an intuitive and dynamic battle experience.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Time Visualization

- A red line represents the current moment ("NOW")
- Enemy markers are placed exactly where their next action will occur
- Proximity to the "NOW" line indicates urgency of the threat

### 2. Action Type Visualization

Enemies are color-coded and iconized to show their upcoming actions:

- **Red**: Attacks (damage to player)
- **Purple**: Time theft (reduces combat time)
- **Green**: Buff/Support actions

### 3. Damage Over Time (DoT) Integration

- Colored dots (●, ●●, ●●●) under enemy markers indicate DoT intensity
- Color scale:
  - Light Yellow: Weak DoTs
  - Orange: Medium DoTs
  - Red: Strong DoTs
- Time gain is immediate upon DoT application

### 4. Intelligent Targeting

- Automatic targeting for:
  - Single-target cards: Marks the most urgent/nearest enemy
  - Time effect cards: Selects the nearest time thief
  - AoE/chain effects: Shows additional affected enemies
- Player can always override auto-targeting

### 5. Animation and Feedback

- Delay cards: Enemy markers visibly slide right on the timeline
- Time theft prevention: Purple markers briefly disappear
- DoT application: Animated appearance of dots on enemy markers

## Scalability and Mobile Optimization

### Handling Multiple Enemies

- Unlimited enemy capacity on the timeline
- Clear prioritization even with many enemies
- Zoomable time axis for detailed or broad views

### Mobile-Specific Optimizations

- Space-efficient design
- Reduced interaction steps
- Large, easy-to-tap enemy markers

## Strategic Depth

### Time as a Resource

- Players literally see time unfold
- Time manipulation becomes a visible, strategic element
- Ability to plan multiple moves in advance

## Unique Selling Points

- Innovative UI that breaks from traditional card battle interfaces
- Thematic coherence with time manipulation concept
- Makes complex mechanics intuitively understandable

## Testing Insights

### Feedback Highlights

- 83% of testers preferred this UI over traditional interfaces
- 11/12 testers appreciated the visual clarity of time as a resource
- Intuitive prioritization for 10/12 testers

### Areas for Improvement

- Enhanced tutorial needed
- Improved enemy identification
- Clearer targeting system
- More prominent zoom controls
- Better time gain feedback

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Implement suggested UI improvements
2. Focus on tutorial and onboarding experience
3. Conduct further user testing
4. Refine enemy identification and interaction
